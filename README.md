# Sentimental Analysis of Restaurant Review
This is my First  Project at 1stop.ai using machine learning.

**Restaurant-Reviews-using-NLP**

A simple project in python which reads a tsv file, cleans the restaurant reviews(text), geneartes a bag-of-words model and uses a classifier which tells whether the review is a positive one or a negative one. 

 **Introduction**
 
Automate detection of different sentiments from textual comments and feedback, A machine learning model is created to understand the sentiments of the restaurant reviews. The problem is that the review is in a textual form and the model should understand the sentiment of the review and automate a result.
The main motive behind this project is to classify whether the given feedback or review in textual context is positive or negative. Reviews can be given to the model and it classifies the review as a negative review or a positive. This shows the satisfaction of the customer or the experience the customer has experienced.
The basic approach was trying a different machine learning model and look for the one who is performing better on that data set. The restaurant reviews are very related to the project topic as reviews are made on websites and we can apply this model on such data sets to get the sentiments.

**Problem Definition**

***-> Task Definition***
To develop a machine learning model to detect different types of sentiments contained in a collection of English sentences or a large paragraph.

I have chosen Restaurant reviews as my topic. Thus, the objective of the model is to correctly identify the sentiments of the users by reviews which is an English paragraph and the result will be in positive or negative only.

For example,

If the review given by the user is:

“ We had lunch here a few times while on the island visiting family and friends. The servers here are just wonderful and have great memories it seems. We sat on the oceanfront patio and enjoyed the view with our delicious wine and lunch. Must try! ”

Then the model should detect that this is a positive review. Thus the output for this text will be Positive.
